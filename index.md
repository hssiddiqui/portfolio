PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University specializing in geospatial data science, remote sensing, machine learning, and statistical frameworks. Studying energy access solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa that integrates satellite analytics and field surveys to detect smallholder irrigation, enabling modeling of electrification costs via stand-alone mini-grids or grid extensions and informing interventions that reduce energy poverty through increased agricultural productivity.

Technical scope includes Python, GIS, ENVI, Google Earth Engine and cloud computing (AWS/GCP), genAI with methods spanning classification, detection, segmentation, mixture modeling, PCA, and spatio-temporal analysis. Experience includes delivery of decision-ready data products for public-sector stakeholders, and instruction of core engineering concepts to 100+ students. Open to collaboration on remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and cloud-native ML for development.
