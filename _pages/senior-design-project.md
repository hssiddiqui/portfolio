# Senior Design Project: Completely Knocked Down (CKD) Design

### Project Goal
To design and validate a Completely Knocked Down (CKD) modular chassis for the Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2018, significantly reducing shipping volume and assembly time while maintaining structural integrity.

### Challenge & Solution

**The Challenge:** International shipping costs and time constraints made transporting a fully assembled vehicle inefficient for the competition.

**The Solution:** We developed a design allowing the vehicle to be disassembled into flat, easily stackable components, reducing the shipping crate size by 60% and cutting on-site assembly from 3 days to less than 8 hours.

### Documentation & Results

This project resulted in a successful entry in the 2018 competition, and the design framework was adopted by the subsequent student team.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
* **Technical Skills:** Experience with SolidWorks, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and advanced material selection.
* **Teamwork:** Managed a team of 5 engineers through all design, prototyping, and testing phases.
* **Metric:** Reduced logistical costs by an estimated $5,000 per competition.

**Important Note:** I used the standard Minimal Mistakes theme helper **`{% raw %}{% include figure %}{% endraw %}`** syntax to ensure the image displays correctly with features like captions and responsiveness.

Do you have any other projects you would like to structure, or would you like feedback on the wording of this specific page?
